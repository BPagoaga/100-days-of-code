# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up my work environment : wordpress, jointsWP theme along with sass, gulp.

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel ok with frameworks such as [jointsWP](http://jointswp.com/). Feels great to set up a cool work environment quickly
